Hey there!

I'm **Niyar**, an M2 student at Université de Toulouse working on NLP, LLM reasoning, and mechanistic interpretability. Sometimes I write CUDA kernels and pretend I know what I'm doing.

This is where I think out loud. A public notebook of sorts: half-baked ideas, research notes, and the occasional breakthrough. Mostly for future me, but you're welcome to stick around.
